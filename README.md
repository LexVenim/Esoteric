# Esoteric

This repositoty contains bunch of small programs in esoteric languages. I try some of them sometimes just for fun of it. 

You can use those examples freely wherever you like. Also, if you know some interesting esoteric language, please tell me in Issues or just email me at lexvenim@gmail.com.
